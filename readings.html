        1. The two articles articulate an ethical problem related to their topic (industry-standard design tools & the current scale and state of open-source tech). Define what you consider to be the authors positions in relation to these two topics and how they overlap. What connections can you draw between these two articles? Do they prescribe solutions that are pertinent to each other?
        <br><br>
        2. Aside from the master of certain digital tools and programs, what skills do you see as integral to your graphic design practice?
    </p></div>

    <div><p id="responses">
        1. From the first reading, Hartnett argues that big brands like Apple and Adobe are, in a sense, brainwashing designers to use their products and platforms, labelling them as "industry standard tools." They purposefully enforce limitations (like Adobe's
        Creative Cloud) onto their users, which demonstrates their prioritization on paying consumers rather than passionate designers. Hartnett further mentions that many users do not understand the programs that they so often use, thus this
        "locking-out" restricts their knowledge and causes them to rely heavily on subscription-based programs like Adobe. As Hartnett states, "...they [Apple and Adobe] exert a kind of duopoly over the practice of graphic design," meaning these
        brands are abusing their power within the industry to conform designers to their platforms. Hartnett is in favour of the concept of open-source software to combat the issue of industry-standard design tools. By creating a platform where
        programmers can exchange code with one another, it allows a space for collaboration, originality, freedom and skill development. Likewise, in the second reading Mueller makes evident that open-source programs are beneficial to
        programmers who want to exchange coding knowledge and skills. However, capitalism becomes a large barrier to open-source platforms. GitHub, for example, is bought by Microsoft, a brand similar to Apple or Adobe. It's ironic how a company
        that also promotes their products and programs as essentials for the graphic design and programming fields now have ownership over an open-source software. By having such a large brand take over GitHub, programmers who post their
        original code work may be overlooked, therefore having Microsoft credited instead. Additionally, because Microsoft owns the entirety of the software, they have the freedom to use that code for themselves in their own platforms, claiming it as
        their own, and not being questioned because of their superior title. Moreover, because Microsoft has the autonomy to do as they please with GitHub's platform, despite stating that they support the concept of a free-source platform, they have the
        power to start charging a fee if so desired. This demonstrates aspects of "hegemony," a term also used to describe the dominance of Apple and Adobe over the graphic design identity in the first reading.
        <br><br>
        2. Aside from digital tools and programs, I find the ability to create designs using traditional tools (e.g., pencil, paper, rulers) are significant to my design practice. It is important to keep in touch with the skills and techniques that my own body is
        capable of producing without the help of a pre-made program. Despite the technological world advancing at an incredible speed, it's crucial for me to understand the basics before developing further into the digital world. Alongside the physical
        tools, it's necessary to know the fundamentals of design, including the visual design elements and principles like contrast, balance, rhythm, hierarchy, etc. As well as being educated on typography, and colour theory to create visually appealing
        works. Furthermore, the ability to think outside-of-the-box to produce unique works is also important, especially considering the ongoing trend of uniformity in the design world (e.g., platforms like wix or squarespace that have templates to choose from) today.

    <h3>Reading Discussion II: <br> Olia Lialina & Laurel Schwulst</h3>
    <br>
    <p><ul id="readingsDiscussions">
        <a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/turing-complete-user/"><li>Turing Complete User</li></a>
        <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/"><li>My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?</li></a>
    </ul></p>

    <div><p id="questions">
        1. What do you think of Lialina's definition of the universal user? Do you think it is a useful category for understanding Schwulst's argument advocating for individual websites over platforms? Explain why and provide at least 1 example.
        <br><br>
        2. What kind of computer user are you? Draw on concepts from Lialina's text, and integrate a quotation in your answer. Make use of a metaphor, if you can, to describe your experience online.
    </p></div>

    <div><p id="responses2">
        1. Lialina defines the Universal User as “[...] users who have the ability to achieve their goals regardless of the primary purpose of an application or device. Such users will find a way to their aspiration without an app or utility programmed
        specifically for it. [...] A Universal User’s mind set means to liaise with hardware and software.” I think Lialina’s definition is trying to convey that these type of users are those who think outside of the box; those who are innovative and are capable of making use of things alternatively, or in ways that are unintended.
        <br><br>
        I do think the concept of the Universal User is useful for understanding Schwulst’s argument advocating for individual websites over platforms. Schwulst argues “we need individuals rather than corporations to guide the web’s future;” so by
        creating isolated websites to share things like news, life-updates, and photos, we are also demonstrating the qualities of the Universal User. Rather than using pre-programmed softwares such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Tiktok, creating a
        website catered to your specific interests and desires becomes an alternative method instead of contributing to big corporations. 
        <br><br>
        Many people create their own websites to blog about certain things such as cooking, traveling, gaming, or even one’s daily lifestyle. An example of a blog is <a href="https://www.travelsintranslation.com/">Beth Leung's travel blog.</a> This blog contains daily posts about
        travel, which includes photos and write-ups on food, popular tourist landmarks, animals, and cultural events. There are even separate pages dedicated to all the different flavours of Fanta and KitKat that Leung has found in the countries that she
        visited. This demonstrates the blogger’s ability to express their own interests, setting herself apart from other websites and common social media platforms. Leung’s first blogs began on Tumblr; however she eventually created her own website as she got more popular with her posts, expressing her ability to act as a Universal User. 
        <br><br>
        2. Personally, I wouldn’t consider myself as an entirely Invisible User, nor a complete Universal User. Rather, I’d say I’m a combination of both depending on my intent. Lialina mentions that Invisible Users “are the ones who’s task is to spend as
        little time as possible with the computer, without wasting a single thought on it. They require a specialized, isolated app for every ‘repetitive thought’ [...].” I will admit that I’ve used (and still do use) pre-programmed apps because of its efficiency.
        Though, I never considered the deeper mechanics and programming involved in how these apps function. I have also noticed that prior to entering university I often took advantage of these apps (mostly social media apps), such as posting photos on
        Instagram to update my friends, or using Twitter to tweet something that happened during my day. However, now that I have learned more about hardware and software mechanics and technology from my Games Studies class, and programming
        and website design from this class and my Typography class, my awareness has increased and I’m beginning to look at apps and websites from a different perspective. Now, I take the time to consider the Universal User’s way of thinking – "[...} to
        liaise with hardware and software. Behavior that is antipodal to the ‘very busy’ user.” (Lialina). For instance, although I still use apps like Instagram, I rarely use it for its intended purpose of posting photos to share with my followers. Instead, I use
        Instagram to document my personal workout progress, almost like a journal entry, but I have it posted on a separate account and set to private with no followers. In this example I am utilizing Instagram in a way that’s opposite to what it was intended
        for – instead of posting to share my life with the world, I hide my posts from others, adjusting the app to cater to my own needs.
        <br><br>
        The metaphor that I can resonate with the most is Schwulst’s “Website as garden.” My experience online is quite similar to how Schwulst describes the website as a garden – “Gardens have their own way each season. In the winter, not much might
        happen and that’s perfectly fine. You might spend the less active months journaling in your notebook: less output, more stirring around on input. You need both.” My activity online is the highest during the spring and summer seasons; therefore, I
        tend to take breaks from social media platforms and update things less frequently during the colder months. However, this doesn’t mean that I’m completely out of touch with my online presence because like Schwulst states, I require both output and input in my life to maintain its balance.

     <h4>Reading Discussion III: <br> Code, Letters, Logic, Play</h4>
    <br>
    <p><ul id="readingsDiscussions">
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5ATijqPdXQ&ab_channel=TheCooperUnion"><li>Math, Logic, Design? with Just van Rossum</li></a>
        <a href="https://www.typotheque.com/articles/the_importance_of_play"><li>The Importance of Play</li></a>
    </ul></p>

    <div><p id="questions">
        1. A key part to generative design and code is pattern and routine. Akin to a chess player, marking each move down, and keeping a trace of your decisions can prove useful for your own process and future making. As a designer, to know that there might be a variety of possibilities to a given situation, can aid our ways of observing by using tools in novel ways. In one series
        of work, Van Rossum looks to fundamentals of waveforms as a departure point and reference point for connecting an interface to affecting the parameters of a letterform. If the letters explode, so too would the speakers. Find 1 unique example of a pattern in nature, that appears to be programmatic. Post a visual of this pattern and describe how it is programmatic in nature. 
    </p></div>

    <div><p id="response3">
        One example of a pattern in nature that appears to be programmatic is water. Van Rossum’s waveform work is similar to how water can be manipulated in different ways. According to the seasons, water can change its direction of flow; or depending on the time of day, water may go from high-tide to low-tide, and vice versa. Season change is a contributing
        variable to this natural manipulation. However, water can also be manipulated by humans as well. For instance, picture a calm and undisturbed body of water; then, imagine skipping stones or throwing a large rock into the water. What was once a calm body of water is now interrupted by an object, therefore causing different wave patterns (waves, ripples, etc.).
        Additionally, imagine a rainy day, and you stumble upon a puddle – as the rain makes contact with the puddle, you may notice small ripples appear where the raindrops land. 
        <br><br>
        Similar to Van Rossum’s control of letterforms using waveforms, one can take control over the wave patterns produced by water using sound (this is known as water cymatics). Water patterns can be altered depending on certain vibrations and sounds – and if done correctly – can create geometric patterns of both organic and inorganic shapes. If you listen to a song
        with an easily recognizable bass at an increased volume, and place a glass of water next to the speaker, you may notice that the water begins to vibrate according to the bass. This is a simple explanation as to how water cymatics function, which allows us to see audio. If you’d like to see a visual example, this is a link to a cymatics installation called <a href="https://www.synthtopia.com/content/2014/02/11/sonic-water-cymatics-makes-audio-visible/">Sonic Water</a>.

    <h5>Reading Discussion IV: <br> In Free Fall, Hito Steyerl</h5>
    <br>
    <p><ul id="readingsDiscussions">
        <a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/24/67860/in-free-fall-a-thought-experiment-on-vertical-perspective/"><li>In Free Fall: A Thought Experiment on Vertical Perspective</li></a>
    </ul></p>

    <div><p id="questions">
        1. What do you make of Steyerl’s point that linear perspective privileges the individual while also lessening one’s humanity by rendering that individual view according to scientific principles? Is it possible to maintain both a humanist and technological perspective?
    </p></div>

    <div><p id="response4">
        In my own words I would define surveillance as the act of observing through one's own physical abilities (what one sees using their eyes) and/or with the assistance of technological tools and resources, such as satellite imagery. According to Steyerl's thought experiment, aerial perspective provides various modes of viewing by making permissible the ability to
        explore all possible orientations of a subject; whereas linear perspectives restrict the viewer to a limited observation, seeing only as much as one's eyes allow them to. Aerial perspective proves advantageous over linear perspectives as we are able to see beyond the body's capabilities in ways humanity would have never thought imaginable prior to the invention of new
        technologies. Because aerial perspectives provide observations made from a God's-eye view, this technology proves functional for the culture of surveillance. For instance, Steyerl makes the argument that aerial views have been widely used for numerous purposes: map views (Google Maps) and navigation, military practices, tracking, and even entertainment (3D
        Cinema). Seeing from above grants us access to a greater viewpoint, pushing us beyond and around the horizon, which is why it is so effective. However, despite the benefits that aerial perspectives provide for humanity there are also consequences that come along with it. Steyerl mentions, "But if we accept the multiplication and de-linearization of horizons
        and perspectives, the new tools of vision may also serve to express, and even alter, the contemporary conditions of disruption and disorientation." I understood this statement as the aerial view creating an illusion of reality, in which we begin to see things as hyperreal abstractions, and thus misinterpreting its true appearance/structure. So, although aerial
        perspective can be extremely helpful in terms of surveillance culture, we must acknowledge that it does distort our reality and we must be considerate with how it is being manipulated in real world applications.
