    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <div><p id="Objective">
        <br>
        Throughout the semester, all of your assignments must be published online in a single site (multiple pages). It will serve as an index of your development throughout the course. Think of this like an online process book.
    </p></div>

    <h3>Site Requirements</h3>
    <p><ul id="siteRequirements">
        <li>Written and visual process reflection</li>
        <li>Images of works in progress as well as final forms</li>
        <li>Links to resources you used throughout the semester (libraries, stackoverflow, readings, peers' work, site inspiration, etc.)</li> 
        <li>Reading responses</li> 
        <li>An index page linking to everything (structured and styled as you see fit)</li>
        <li>Any other content you feel represents your growth as a web-based artist/designer this semester</li>
        <li>Be entirely hand-coded by you</li>
        <li>Live online</li>
        <li>Be thoughtfully designed and developed</li>
    </ul></p>

        For my course index I decided to make a visual representation of my work habits, thus I went with a more dark theme as I am most productive during the night. I wanted to recreate a night time atmosphere with a black background, vibrant colours, and neon signs to symbolize the 
        LED lights that I have on when working on assignments late at night. Moreover, I chose to take a more minimal approach, making the website easy to navigate, which reflects my organized and systematic work ethics. For instance, I incorporated many lists throughout the pages on my website because it is
        a method I often use to organize my thoughts and plan out my assignments. I also tried to make each page as uniform as possible to have consistency between all my pages and to make the viewing experience as smooth as possible.
        <br><br>
        I intentionally did not incorporate animated elements as I thought it would be distracting and somewhat overwhelming for a relaxing environment, so instead I used interactive elements such as hovering over blurred text, or clicking through a slideshow to engage with the viewer and 
        keep them interested. This minimal approach reflects how I prefer to work at night as it is a time of concentration and productivity â€“ I try to avoid any distractions as much as possible. Although some viewers may not find my website as fun as others, this decision was made to evoke a sense of embodiment; to allow others to experience the way I work in an authentic way.
        <br><br>
        Overall, despite the times of frustration when coding this website, I am very satisfied and proud of how it turned out as I think it reflects my personality and work habits effectively. Working on my website almost every week allowed me to practice what I've been learning in class, and therefore I became more familiar and more comfortable with many concepts. Using my own knowledge to code my very own functioning website is quite rewarding, and I hope I 
        will be able to expand my knowledge and someday recreate this website with stronger coding skills in the future. Please enjoy exploring my website, and thank you for your time!
