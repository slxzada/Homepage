    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p id="Objective">For this assignment, you are tasked with developing a daily practice of "code sketches." Rather than constructing a single project, your goal is to allot daily time to exploring generative art. With your assigned letter as your inspiration, create 21 code "sketches" of that letter in p5 over the course of 3 weeks.</p>
   <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
   <p><ul id="learningObjectives">
       <li>Develop their knowledge of fundamental programming concepts</li>
       <li>Explore new and non-traditional ways of making beyond the parameters of existing design software</li>
       <li>Refine formal approach through experimentation and iteration</li>  
       <li>Learn how a generative approach can aid in future meaning-making</li>
       <li>Embrace happy 'mistakes': unexpected results</li>
       <li>Develop a daily practice of learning through making</li>
       <li>Problem solve alone and with other students</li>
    </ul></p>

    Prior to this course I had no experience with coding, so when I found out that I was going to use coding for this assignment, I was quite nervous and didn't know what to expect. However, after going through the tutorials in class I was able to learn about the fundamentals of coding to produce work that I never thought I would be able to do. By following class examples and exploring the <a href=https://p5js.org/reference/>p5 reference sheet</a> to discover new methods of coding, I was able to combine multiple codes to produce eye-catching pieces of generative art. There were also a few times where I would make mistakes in my code, but most of the time I kept my mistakes because it was more of a successful fail. Throughout the duration of my daily sketches I found myself appreciating and embracing the happy accidents rather than getting frustrated over them.
    <br><br>
    Moreover, through this assignment I acknowledged how important it is to pay attention to details; one tiny mistake and it could ruin your entire code. This helped me develop a stronger sense of concentration and attention to every minute detail. By closely scanning through my code, I was able to figure out mistakes and errors and correct them accordingly.
    <br><br>
    Although coding is quite the challenge, Iâ€™m glad that I was able to step outside of my comfort zone to learn something new. In the beginning I was quite annoyed with many concepts because they were all things that I have never done before. However, after practicing daily I began to familiarize myself with many of the concepts, and thus sketching became much easier and more enjoyable to do.
