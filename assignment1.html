    <h2>Objective </h2>
    <br><br>
    <p id="body">Design a 24" x 36" digital poster about either 1) your life under COVID-19 or 2) how you you see the future of design, without using software explicity intended for design.</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2> 
    <br><br>
    <ol id="body2">
        <li>Explore new and non-traditional ways of making beyond the parameters of existing design software.</li>
        <li>Refine formal approach from experimentation to mastery through iteration and development.</li>
        <li>Using form, process, archive, metonymy, framing and other non-narrative approaches to represent complex ideas.</li>
        </ol> 
    <br><br><br><br>
    <h2>Apps used to compose this poster</h2>
    <br><br>
    <ol id="appList">
        <li>CollaNote</li>
        <li>Sticker.ly</li>
        <li>Pico-8</li>
        <li>Notes app</li>
        <li>Facetime</li>

    <p id="bodypara">The concept behind this piece was finding a way to cope with the COVID-19 lockdowns that have been put into place the past couple of years. I wanted to convey a sense of contrast between the things that I have missed out on due to the lockdowns with the activities that helped me push through it. To visually express this idea I decided to show the things that helped me cope in colour, and all the things that I’ve missed in black and white.
    <br><br><br>
    Originally my poster was supposed to be composed entirely out of screenshots of pico-8 creations, but virtually building multiple individual objects was overly time consuming so I decided to only make the main representative objects of what helped me cope. I also incorporated elements from other apps such as video call recordings, Google Maps, and the Calendar app to add more graphics.
    <br><br><br>
    Not being able to use any design programs was definitely a challenge, but I was able to use an app called CollaNote to arrange photos and clippings in a collage format. Now that I determined how I could arrange my images, the next issue was determining how I could cut around the images to get rid of any unnecessary backgrounds. I did some research and came across a sticker making app called sticker.ly which allowed me to cut around images and save them as png files. This made it much easier for me to import them into CollaNote and arrange them accordingly. The CollaNote app also had different photo-editing features that I made use of, such as filters and a tool that enabled me to create the glitched/pixelated calendar boxes on my poster.
    <br><br><br>
    Although the assignment restricted me from using any design programs, it made me realize how much designers really depend on these preprogrammed applications to do all the difficult work for us. We truly don’t know how these programs are coded to function, and thus we tend to overlook the power of these programs. Considering that one program can do what multiple individual programs and apps can do is incredibly eye-opening, and I am now increasingly appreciative of programs that make our work as designers ten times easier for us to express our creativity.</p>
